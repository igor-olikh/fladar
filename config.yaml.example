# Flight Search Configuration

# Origin cities (always the same)
origins:
  person1: "TLV"  # Tel Aviv
  person2: "ALC"  # Alicante

# Note: Timezones are automatically detected using the airportsdata library
# No manual timezone configuration is needed

# Search parameters
search:
  # Date range for outbound flights (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
  outbound_date: "2025-11-20"
  
  # Date range for return flights (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
  return_date: "2025-11-25"
  
  # Maximum price per person for round trip (in EUR)
  max_price: 600
  
  # Search radius for nearby airports (in kilometers)
  # If set, the application will search for flights from nearby airports within this radius
  # This is useful for major cities like Tel Aviv where multiple airports might serve the area
  # Set to 0 or empty to disable nearby airport search (use only the specified origin)
  # Recommended: 200-500 km for major cities, 0 for smaller airports
  nearby_airports_radius_km: 200  # e.g., 200 km radius around Tel Aviv
  
  # Maximum number of stops for each person (0 = direct flights only)
  max_stops_person1: 0  # Maximum stops for Person 1 flights
  max_stops_person2: 0  # Maximum stops for Person 2 flights
  
  # Arrival time tolerance in hours (how close arrivals should be)
  arrival_tolerance_hours: 6
  
  # Maximum flight duration in hours (e.g., 5 = only destinations reachable within 5 hours)
  # Set to 0 or empty to disable duration filtering
  max_flight_duration_hours: 0  # 0 = no limit, or set to e.g., 5 for 5-hour max
  
  # Use dynamic destination discovery from Amadeus API instead of predefined list
  # true = use Amadeus Flight Inspiration Search API to find destinations dynamically
  # false = use predefined list of popular destinations
  use_dynamic_destinations: true
  
  # Cache expiration for destination data (in days)
  # Cached destination data will be refreshed after this many days
  # Set to 0 to disable caching
  destination_cache_expiration_days: 30
  
  # Enable/disable flight result caching
  # When enabled, flight search results are cached for the same day
  # Flights for a specific date don't change during the same day, so caching saves API calls
  # Set to false to always fetch fresh results from the API
  use_flight_cache: true
  
  # Maximum number of destinations to check (limits API usage)
  # If the API or predefined list returns 100 destinations, but you set this to 20,
  # only the first 20 destinations will be searched for flights
  # Set to 0 or empty to check all available destinations (not recommended for large lists)
  # Recommended: 20-50 for testing, 50-100 for production
  max_destinations_to_check: 50
  
  # Specific destinations to check (optional)
  # If provided, ONLY these destinations will be checked (skips destination discovery API)
  # If empty or not provided, uses normal destination discovery logic (dynamic or predefined)
  # Format: List of IATA airport codes (e.g., ["BCN", "MAD", "PAR"])
  # Example: destinations_to_check: ["BCN", "MAD", "PAR", "AMS"]
  destinations_to_check: []  # Empty list = use normal discovery logic
  
  # Optional departure time constraints (format: HH:MM, leave empty to disable)
  # These constraints apply to BOTH Person 1 and Person 2 flights
  # 
  # Minimum departure time for outbound flights (going to destination)
  min_departure_time_outbound: "14:00"  # e.g., "08:00" - don't fly earlier than this time
  
  # Minimum departure time for return flights (when leaving FROM the destination)
  # This checks when the flight departs FROM the destination airport, NOT when it arrives back at origin
  min_departure_time_return: "14:00"  # e.g., "10:00" - don't leave destination earlier than this time

# API Configuration
api:
  # Amadeus API credentials (get free API key at https://developers.amadeus.com/)
  amadeus_api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
  amadeus_api_secret: "YOUR_API_SECRET_HERE"
  
  # Environment: "test", "production", or "live"
  # - test: Uses test.api.amadeus.com (for testing with limited data)
  # - production: Uses api.amadeus.com (for real-time data, requires production credentials)
  # - live: Same as "production" - uses api.amadeus.com (alias for production)
  environment: "test"  # Change to "production" or "live" when ready for live data

# Output settings
output:
  # Output formats: "console", "csv", or both: "console,csv"
  format: "console,csv"
  
  # CSV output file path
  csv_file: "flight_results.csv"
  
  # HTML output file path (automatically generated when CSV output is enabled)
  # Shows top 3 destinations with best flight in a beautiful, human-readable format
  html_file: "flight_results.html"
