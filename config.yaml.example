# Timezone configuration for airports (optional - defaults provided for common airports)
# Format: IATA code: timezone name (e.g., "Asia/Jerusalem", "Europe/Madrid")
# If not specified, defaults will be used for common airports
# These timezones are used to convert UTC flight times to local times in CSV output
timezones:
  TLV: "Asia/Jerusalem"  # Tel Aviv
  ALC: "Europe/Madrid"   # Alicante
  # Add more as needed, or rely on built-in defaults for common European airports

# Search parameters
search:
  # Date range for outbound flights (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
  outbound_date: "2025-11-20"
  
  # Date range for return flights (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
  return_date: "2025-11-25"
  
  # Maximum price per person for round trip (in EUR)
  max_price: 600
  
  # Maximum number of stops (0 = direct flights only)
  max_stops: 0
  
  # Arrival time tolerance in hours (how close arrivals should be)
  arrival_tolerance_hours: 6
  
  # Maximum flight duration in hours (e.g., 5 = only destinations reachable within 5 hours)
  # Set to 0 or empty to disable duration filtering
  max_flight_duration_hours: 0  # 0 = no limit, or set to e.g., 5 for 5-hour max
  
  # Use dynamic destination discovery from Amadeus API instead of predefined list
  # true = use Amadeus Flight Inspiration Search API to find destinations dynamically

  use_dynamic_destinations: true
  
  # Optional departure time constraints (format: HH:MM, leave empty to disable)
  # These constraints apply to BOTH Person 1 and Person 2 flights
  # 
  # Minimum departure time for outbound flights (going to destination)
  min_departure_time_outbound: "14:00"  # e.g., "08:00" - don't fly earlier than this time
  
  # Minimum departure time for return flights (coming back from destination)
  min_departure_time_return: "14:00"  # e.g., "10:00" - don't fly earlier than this time

# API Configuration

  # Amadeus API credentials (get free API key at https://developers.amadeus.com/)
  amadeus_api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

  # - production: Uses api.amadeus.com (for real-time data, requires production credentials)
  # - live: Same as "production" - uses api.amadeus.com (alias for production)
